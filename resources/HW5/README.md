Notes for my team: 
To see the interactive plotting widget, go to analysis>HW5.ipynb.
 Launch the notebook and follow the steps from there. 



Notes for the TA: 
To grade my homework 5, please go the the HW5.ipynb. That notebook will walk you through all the steps. 

I screenshot the pep8 test and unit test results if you want to see how they ran for me. That is saved as proofofrun_hw5.pmng in the HW5 home directory. 

Thanks!
