Welcome to the Map ToolPack!

If you are grading this for CSE599, mapping.ipynb is the file you need. You will not be able to run the code unless you follow the set-up instructions described in Python API Instructions, but I have provided screenshots (see below) to demonstrate what the outputs look like. 

********************************************************************************

The purpose of this directory is to provide information and procedures for using a Python API to call Google Earth Engine and perform geospatial operations from the IPython Notebook platform. 

Key documents in this directory include: 

**ee_python_api_instructions** 
contains directions for how to set up an Earth Engine user account with a Python user interface for first time users. 

**ee_mapping.ipynb**
Provides a demo script showing how to initialize Earth Engine and visualize data interactively with a map widget. 

**ee_utils**
Contains useful functions to check and make sure authentication and initialization is running smoothly. 

**ee_debug** 
Debugs simple tasks from the mapping.ipynb and ee_utils using unit tests

**define_google_maps_interactive_widget.ipynb**
Tyler Erickson's useful code that you will need to display maps inline in your IPython notebook. 

**demo images**
Including screenshots of the interactive mapping widget displaying both in situ field-collected data (chemistry) and remotely sensed imagery (satellites).

Enjoy!
