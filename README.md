### About this package:
Rivers, lakes and wetlands are generally known to be net sources of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere as they regularly emit CO2 and CH4, but much work remains quantifying spatial variability and sources, especially for large river systems highly impacted by human activities and infrastructure. The motivation behind this collaborative effort is to build an online, open-source tool for synthesizing remotely sensed watershed-related geospatial data with in situ field observations of water chemistry. Our ultimate goal is to automate data ingestion, fusion and exploration to help understand the patterns and controls driving changes in aquatic greenhouse gases to help inform regional and global carbon budgets.

### License:
For this project, we chose the MIT License, as we wanted our licensing to be simple and allow others to use and improve our software.

### Directory structure is as follows:
- **Data** directory with subdirectories **Mississippi** and **Amazon** to separately store the data files associated with each of those rivers.
- **Analysis** directory to store ipython notebooks and other files associated with our development of the data analysis toolpak.
