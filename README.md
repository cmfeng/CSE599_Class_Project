# eRivers

### About this package:
Rivers, lakes and wetlands are generally known to be net sources of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere as they regularly emit CO2 and CH4, but much work remains quantifying spatial variability and sources, especially for large river systems highly impacted by human activities and infrastructure. The motivation behind this collaborative effort is to build an online, open-source tool for synthesizing remotely sensed watershed-related geospatial data with in situ field observations of water chemistry. Our ultimate goal is to automate data ingestion, fusion and exploration to help understand the patterns and controls driving changes in aquatic greenhouse gases to help inform regional and global carbon budgets.


### Dependencies and how to install
#### Required Packages:
* matplotlib
* pandas
* Bokeh
* scikit-learn
* numpy
* statsmodels

Here are two ways to install packages:

#### 1. If you are already an Anaconda user, you can simply run the command:

conda install bokeh

This will install the most recent published Bokeh release from the Continuum Analytics Anaconda repository, along with all dependencies.

#### 2. Alternatively, it is possible to install from PyPI using pip:

pip install bokeh
